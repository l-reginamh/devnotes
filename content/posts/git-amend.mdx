When we are working on task, not every time only one commit would be pushed. Human make mistakes, so in the situation where we have pushed our commit, but we realized something was missing and we don't want to push another commit, what we can do here is we **amend the commit**.

Firstly, we use the git status command to check on the files that has been modified.
```bash
git status
```

Then, we use git add command to add the modified file to git.
```bash
git add modified-file.txt
```

To amend the commit without changing the commit message, we need to use â€”no-edit flag.
```bash
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

While to amend the commit and changing the commit message, we use the -m flag.
```bash
git commit --amend -m "write the new commit message here."
```

And last, we'll need to git push the changes.
```bash
git push origin branch-name -f
```
