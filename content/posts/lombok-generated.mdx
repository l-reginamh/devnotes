Create a `lombok.config` file in our Java project root and add the following configuration in the file:

```yaml
config.stopbubbling=true #tells the configuration system not to search for config files in the parent directories
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation=true #to mark all generated methods with @lombok.Generated. This will be removing lombok generated methods from package scanning or code coverage tools.
```
